# Domain Moddelling

## Introduction
 Domain models are a key part of the initial planning and analysis phase in software development. They provide a structured visualization of the knowledge and key concepts within a problem domain. By illustrating entities, attributes, roles and relationships. Furthermore,  Domain models act as a blueprint for the development of more detailed system designs and implementations.

## Why are Domain Models Important?

1. **Understanding the Problem Space**: Domain models help in understanding the problem domain and the entities interacting within it, which is crucial before any code is written.
2. **Communication Tool**: They serve as a visual and intuitive communication tool among various stakeholders, including developers, designers, and business personnel.
3. **Foundation for System Design**: Domain models form the basis for further design and development activities, including database design and system implementation.
4. **Identifying Key Entities**: They help in identifying the key entities and their relationships, ensuring a cohesive and comprehensive understanding of the system's structure.

## Role of Domain Models

- **Conceptual Representation**: Domain models provide a high-level conceptual understanding of the domain without delving into detailed implementation specifics.
- **Focus on Main Entities**: They focus on the main entities and often omit less critical details, allowing for a clearer overview of the system's core.
- **Facilitate Discussion and Analysis**: They are used to facilitate discussion and analysis about the system's requirements and expected behavior.

## About the Models in this directory

In this directory, you will find domain models that represent different systems I have analyzed and designed. Each model is crafted to represent the key entities and relationships within specific problem domains. Here are the models included:

1. **ATM Domain Model**
   - Description: This model represents the main components and actors involved in an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) system. It details the interactions between cardholders, accounts, and banking transactions.

2. **Public Transport Card Machine Domain Model** 
  - Description: This model outlines the entities involved in a public transport card machine system, including cards, riders, and transaction processes.

3. **Home of the Elderly Domain Model**
  - Description: This domain model visualizes the system for managing a home for the elderly, highlighting the key entities such as residents, staff, and services provided.

## Using These Models

Feel free to explore these models to understand more about the structure and relationships in various domains. They can serve as examples or inspiration for your own domain modeling or as educational resources for learning about domain analysis.

## Conclusion

Domain models are more than just drawings; they are a fundamental step in the creation of any robust software system. They provide clarity and direction for subsequent design and development phases.
