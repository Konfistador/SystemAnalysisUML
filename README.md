## Unified Modeling Language (UML) Diagrams by Mino Karadzhov

### Introduction
This repository hosts a collection of Unified Modelling Language diagrams, that I've created as part of my Software Engineering studies. These diagrams reflect my understanding and skillset in System Analysis, Design and Modeling, using UML.

### Few words on the Module: Analysis and Design.
This module focused on teaching systematic analysis and design approaches in software engineering. Some of the key learning points included:
- Object-Oriented Analysis and Design.
- Domain analysis.
- Use case analysis.
- Creating various UML diagrams (Use case,Domain, Class,Sequence, Activity, etc.).
- Understanding software system requirements and modeling them effectively.
- Communicating solutions and problems via diagrams.
